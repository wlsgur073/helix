 * Trust-store files that have been left BESIDE the ledger instead of under `home`.
 *
 * Before the trust store's location was pinned to `home`, it was derived as the ledger's own
 * directory — so anyone who pointed `HELIX_LEDGER` somewhere had their signing key, registry and
 * witness created there too. Pinning `home` now silently orphans that state: a fresh key mints,
 * every grade the old key conferred dies, and a witness that still attests to this scope is left
 * behind where a rollback can no longer be detected against it. That is a trust reset, and it must
 * be reported rather than performed.
 *
 * Returns the stray names in `TRUST_FILE_NAMES` order, or an empty array when there is nothing to
 * migrate — which includes the ordinary case where the ledger simply lives in `home`.
 *
 * The two directories are compared CANONICALLY. A textual compare would fire on a `HELIX_HOME` with
 * a trailing separator, since `dirname()` normalises one side and the environment variable does not
 * — refusing to start for a user whose configuration was correct all along.
